# Simple Jenkins Pipeline Skeleton

This repository contains a basic Jenkins pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`) that defines the structure for a CI/CD workflow with build, test, and deploy stages.

Currently, the pipeline uses placeholder steps (echo commands) to demonstrate the workflow stages.

## Purpose

- To practice creating a Jenkins pipeline file  
- To understand CI/CD pipeline stages and flow  
- To set up groundwork for future automation and deployment

## Tools Used

- Jenkins  
- Git (GitHub)

## Next Steps

- Add actual build, test, and deployment commands as skills improve  
- Integrate Docker containerization and deployment in later stages
